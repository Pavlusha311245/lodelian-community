## What is Lodelian?

Lodelian is an application for managing the Nginx Unit web server, which simplifies local deployment on your PC. With Lodelian, you can launch a web server for development in PHP, Go, Ruby, and other programming languages or use static hosting. Lodelian provides the ability to set up domains in a local environment, as well as the ability to use SSL/TLS for a secure connection. This allows testing applications in conditions that are as close to real-world scenarios as possible.
